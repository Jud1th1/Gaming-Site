## Overview

A gaming tech accessories website created in ComputerCoach Front-End class.

### The challenge
Cover Image with Call-to-Action Button 
- Add a cover image under the four descriptions. The call-to-action button should say "SEE TODAY'S DEAL"

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links
- Live Site URL: https://gamesceneaccessories.netlify.app/

## My process

- This website was created from a template provided to me. I was to go in and add a cover image with a call to action button. 
- 1. I went into the html file to update the company name and text to reflect a gaming accessory store as opposed to the keyboard site it originally was. 
- 2. Under the feature item section I added my div class called cover-image for the image and button I was going to add. Help was found from here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp
- 3. I found images from Unsplash that I wanted to use as well as icons from Free3Dicon.
- 4. I removed the root colors and created my own palette 
- 5. I added the css for my image first and then the text. I copied some code from the pre-order now button so it matched the ones already on the site. 
- 6. I changed the text colors to my new root colors, as well as the buttons and button hover states. 
- 7. I increased the opacity on the grid-1 image because the overlying green color was fading the image.
